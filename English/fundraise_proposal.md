# Niccolo marketing fundraise proposal.

## Introduction:

The revolution of artificial intelligence models has become the most debated double-edged sword of technology today. Over the past year, the market cap of AI has increased from about 30 billion dollars to 420 billion, which clearly shows the rapid growth and transformation of this technology. On the one hand, artificial intelligence can contribute to the growth and improvement of almost all human aspects, including engineering, medicine, education, business development, transportation, etc. On the other hand, it can be a tool for the misuse by governments and (especially) free-market companies for political and economic purposes. The difference between these two lies in the type of distribution of artificial intelligence models and data.

If artificial intelligence models are exclusively provided by private companies or governments, we face two main dangers.

1. Manipulation (propaganda and enticing brainwashing): Even today, we see that the very popular GPT-4 model, presented by OpenAI, shows how much this tool has been manipulated to lie in favor of the American left-wing, who are the main investors of OpenAI, on political and medical issues! It is much easier for users today to ask their questions from artificial intelligence instead of searching different websites, and these data are manipulated in the interest of the manufacturing company.
2. Personal models: The data that various users inject into AI engines cause artificial intelligence information to be upgraded. Companies can misuse this data to upgrade their informal models and start mind-reading people using this tool and use this power to control people for personal benefits. The recent incident at OpenAI is a testament to this. While rumors were heard about work on AGI (a smarter model than artificial intelligence), Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, was fired and returned to his previous position almost 10 days later. OpenAI has not made public the reason for Sam Altman's dismissal.

Almost all people who deal with artificial intelligence are somewhat familiar with these concerns. Influential figures like Elon Musk (CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and Twitter) and Geoffrey Hinton (known as the godfather of AI and the former head of Google's AI department) have publicly expressed their warning about the danger of monopolizing artificial intelligence in several interviews.


## Problem:

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, announced in an interview in front of reporters and investors that he assures that no person or company will be able to compete with ChatGPT. About two weeks later, the Claude 2 service and the open-source TensorFlow model were released, both of which are available today and provide answers on par with GPT-4 (sometimes weaker, sometimes stronger).
The developer community is constantly developing and upgrading new models and sharing them publicly, and this trend is a positive sign to prevent monopolies of free market companies and misuse of AI. Technical and programming groups have shared a golden resume of their models and algorithms in this short time, which is highly commendable, but the problem they generally face is monetizing and generating income from these models. Before OpenAI released the GPT-4 model, Sam Altman himself faced the same problem. He stated in a public seminar that he had no plan or even an idea to make his company profitable, after which Microsoft bought OpenAI.
Today, the force that moves this group forward is their personal interests and curiosities about creating new models and solving various problems, but if a suitable path for generating income from this service is not created, good resources will either become extinct or fall into the monopoly of other companies.


## Solution:

The Niccolo platform is designed to solve this problem. Niccolo, by combining proof-of-work blockchain and the AI calculation, has designed an ecosystem to connect network subscribers (developers - miners - users and data providers). With this protocol, people can use AI freely, without censorship, without interruption, without monopoly, and in a decentralized way, upgrade it, and earn income from it. To design an AI machine, you need three tools:

1. Artificial Intelligence Algorithm
    1. The algorithm is actually the arrangement of your artificial neural network. A list of different functions that process the user's input value and convert it to a standard output.
2. Processing resources (RAM - CPU - HARD - GPU)
    1. AI computations, depending on the type of algorithm, are usually heavy computations that require high processing power, provided by hardware.
3. Data Bank
    1. By providing the necessary algorithm and hardware, you have a virtual brain. Now it's time to add knowledge to this brain. Data banks are information in the form of text, photos, code, and other data that make up the encyclopedia of this intelligence.

The Niccolo platform connects these three groups with a decentralized and automatic communication protocol on the blockchain, delivers the AI robot to the general public, and distributes the income from buying its subscription in the form of Nicco tokens among the producers.

- Suppose you are a programmer who has designed a new algorithm or upgraded an old one.

The Niccolo platform allows you to share your model with the public and earn income based on the use users make of this model. Your income will be in the form of Nicco tokens, which are tradable in all decentralized exchanges.

- In addition, you may not have technical knowledge but have access to hardware such as CPU and graphics. You can earn income by sharing the processing power of these hardwares on the network.

This activity is almost similar to the classic model of Bitcoin mining, with the difference that in Bitcoin or similar coins, the user's processing power is wasted. The mining process in Bitcoin and similar blockchains is that an encrypted string is created, and mining devices start breaking its lock by testing different codes. Whoever finds the answer sooner gets the prize. This string has no other use, and in other words, it wastes all the electricity and wear and tear that has gone into this processing. But in Niccolo, mining is not done by testing different codes, but by sharing the consumptive power of hardware to answer users' questions by AI.

- There is also another case where you can share your big data and earn income based on the answers that are analyzed from those data. Businesses that have useful databases can translate it into the protocol format and share it. These data are validated and rated based on the overall reputation rate of users.

In the end, the simple user can buy a monthly subscription or get an API service with Nicco tokens. On a simple page similar to the ChatGPT website, they can ask their question to AI and receive an answer.



## Investment Plan:

In the current version of Niccolo 2, there are two blockchain contracts, one for the Nicco token and another for MLM. In addition, the initial artificial intelligence model ggml-niccolo-7b-q1 will be available to all customers. This model was designed by the Niccolo development team and trained on 32 terabytes of data for 1 year, and today it can answer user questions with acceptable accuracy. The difference between this model and other available models is that there is no censorship on it, and in addition to the model itself, its database is also designed open-source. There are no restrictions on the answers sent by this service.

Niccolo's current goal is to start the public sale of the Nicco token by raising a budget of $50,000 entirely for advertising. The Niccolo project uses the MLM (Multi-level marketing) model instead of the traditional ICO model for this stage of platform development. The reason for choosing this model is to reduce advertising costs, increase the speed of capital attraction, and decentralize the network. The general process of the plan is that the user makes their first purchase with a minimum of $50, in return for which they receive the Nicco token and access to the ggml-niccolo AI. However, instead of the person's investment ending at this stage, the MLM smart contract rewards the user with 1% of the user's receipt as profit daily.

Suppose the user has paid $100 and received the equivalent of 500,000 Nicco (equivalent to 500,000 units of charge in the AI robot, about 250-400 questions and answers in the robot). Here, the user's profitability plan begins, and the user will have a daily income of $1. Clearly, by the next 100 days, the person's own capital can provide his return on investment, and the 101st dollar is provided by the valuable token Nicco backed by the AI model.

The reason for naming MLM on this model is that after the user charges their robot, they can invite other users to the project and receive a reward in return. These rewards continue up to 3 levels of subcategories and can increase the customer's profit by up to 8.5%. Also, robot charging plans are offered in 3 plans - silver - gold and platinum. This means that if the user initially deposits $300, instead of 1%, they start with 2% daily, and if they increase this amount to 600%, the profit rate becomes 3%.

These profits are considered as the network's net reward and are assigned to the user to reduce advertising costs. The main product of the network, which is the ggml-niccolo robot charge and Nicco token, will be available to the user immediately after charging the account.
