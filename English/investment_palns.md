## Special Bonus

if you leave your earnings in your account without withdrawing, we give you a bonus! This bonus starts at an extra 0.1% on your daily rewards and grows by 0.1% every day you don't withdraw, up to a maximum of 1%. That's like getting free money for letting your earnings grow!
For example, if you're on the Starter Plan and invest $100, you earn $1 every day. If you don't withdraw your earnings, you get an extra $0.10 on the second day, $0.20 on the third day, and so on, until you're earning an extra $1 every day. But if you withdraw your earnings, the bonus resets and starts growing again the next day.

1. **Investment Rewards (30% of total supply, 300 million tokens)**: When you invest in any of the plans (Starter, Gold, or Platinum), you'll earn Nicco tokens in addition to your daily USDT rewards. This is a direct reward for your investment and a way to thank you for trusting and supporting the platform.
2. **Referral Rewards (20% of total supply, 200 million tokens)**: When you invite others to join and they invest in any of the plans, you'll earn Nicco tokens as a reward.

6. **Liquidity Provision (10% of total supply, 100 million tokens)**: If you provide liquidity for the Nicco token on exchanges, you'll earn Nicco tokens as a reward. This ensures that everyone can easily buy and sell Nicco tokens whenever they want.
