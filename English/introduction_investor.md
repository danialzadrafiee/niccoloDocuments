# Niccolo introduction

Niccolo is a blockchain-based platform on Polygon that connects AI developers to each other and to users. Simply put, Niccolo enables AI developers to share their tools and skills, and rather than working individually, expand AI robots within a collaborative ecosystem. Furthermore, they can directly receive their share of revenue from user payments in proportion to their services.

Members of the Niccolo platform are divided into 4 main groups: Foundation, Providers, Investors, and Users.

1. Foundation: The team behind the Niccolo platform, including programmers and initial investors.
2. Providers:
   - Developers: Programmers responsible for creating and upgrading artificial intelligence algorithms.
   - Resource Providers: Individuals who share their GPU power, RAM, and CPU processing power with the network.
   - Data Providers: Individuals who publish their big data banks to the platform.
3. Investors: Individuals who finance the ecosystem's expenses by participating in Niccolo's IMO.
4. Users: The end-users who benefit from the artificial intelligence robots service provided by Niccolo.

#### Example:

Jack is a skilled programmer who specializes in writing algorithms and is interested in expanding his activities in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). He has developed a prominent algorithm for answering mathematical questions. However, he faces two major challenges: the lack of sufficient budget to purchase powerful processing equipment and the absence of a clear path to introduce his developed models and earn revenue from them. These challenges have led Jack, despite his expertise and outstanding skills in developing and optimizing AI algorithms, to consider moving to a safer field.

The Niccolo platform can assist Jack. Jack can synchronize his AI algorithm with Niccolo's input and output protocol and share it on the platform. He can specify the data banks of his robot and train his algorithm on network resources without any cost. At this stage, Jack optimizes his algorithm and places it on the network at no cost. Here, Jack can use two methods to generate income. Firstly, Jack's robot exists exclusively on the network, and anyone who works with that robot rewards Jack according to their activity level. Secondly, if a user asks a question in the public Niccolo robot that the Niccolo algorithm determines should be reviewed by Jack's algorithm, after calculating the answer to this question, Jack also profits from this section.

### Niccolo Advantage:

AI robots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude are centrally managed by companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. This situation limits the quality of responses from these robots to the performance of the developing companies, which might misuse user information or direct responses in their favor. However, Niccolo, by offering an open-source and transparent structure, eliminates these limitations. In this structure, all tools and data are fully transparent and available to users and developers. Therefore, the quality of responses and the intelligence of robots are not limited to a specific company or group. Programmers from around the world can collaborate in creating or enhancing algorithms and receive their rewards directly from the network. Also, with transparent data banks, users can review and manage the sources of their responses.

Niccolo allows developers to focus on coding without the need for marketing efforts. Additionally, programmers can work in teams with colleagues from around the world, without being limited to a specific company. These opportunities enable programmers to make the best use of their abilities while also providing users with access to better services.

In summary, Niccolo offers programmers the opportunity to directly profit from their algorithms. On the other hand, users gain access to more powerful robots and receive final answers without censorship and propaganda.

#### 1: Designing the IMO and MVP models (Completed)

- IMO Model: This model is a method for raising capital by offering tokens, somewhat similar to ICOs. In this model, the general public pre-purchases Nicco tokens, which are the currency unit of the Nicolo platform. They can also earn rewards by referring others to the platform through a referral code. Blockchain users are quite familiar with this process, detailed in the IMO implementation section.

- AI MVP Product: The Nicolo project has designed an exclusive and minimal AI robot with the aim of showcasing its future products. This robot has been trained on approximately 32 terabytes of data with the GGLM algorithm for about a year and ultimately, with a 16-gigabyte output, can provide uncensored and undistorted textual responses to English language queries. The importance of this robot at this stage is to create a greater sense of trust in the project's token buyers and acquaint them with the project's future vision. Also, the absence of an MVP leads some crypto advertising influencers to either completely reject advertising requests or charge more.

#### 2: Raising Advertising Capital (Current Phase)

- Raising advertising capital (current phase) for the Nicolo project, given the current market situation, requires a budget of approximately $45,000 to make its voice heard to the general public. This budget will be entirely spent on direct Nicolo advertising, especially on the Twitter platform. The profit for the advertising budget provider will be settled immediately after the IMO to protect the principal capital and the provider's profit against potential future risks and fluctuations of the project.

#### 3: Advertising Execution
The Nicolo project's advertising execution has three main winning cards that can guarantee the success of the IMO based on past market patterns.

1. Ready Product:
    - Many blockchain projects do not have a product or MVP to present before raising capital, which is somewhat logical. In the early stages of an ICO, the process is more dependent on advertising than technology. However, it is necessary to spend more on advertising because certain influencers, who have customers with more liquid token assets, charge more for appearing in advertisements. Moreover, despite all the advertising, having a tangible MVP provides a better feeling for the general customer.

2. Bullish Market:
    - There's a truth in the crypto financial market: the weakest projects, if introduced in an upward trend, can succeed; while the best projects, if entered into a downward trend, face a higher risk of failure. This small but vital point in project launch timing is a strong lever for attracting more capital and a stronger start for the Nicolo project.

3. AI Trend:
    - Being in line with the trend, at least in the early phases of crypto projects, plays a significant role. Sometimes, this one factor can be enough for a project's success. There are projects known as meme-coins where creators, by merely offering a token without any technology or specific goal, manage to obtain significant budgets simply because the token's name aligns with the trend. Of course, this does not guarantee the project's longevity but plays a vital role in the beginning and as long as it returns the advertising expenses.

#### 3: IMO Execution
One of the common trading methods in the crypto market is participating in pre-sales of shares (in the form of tokens) of crypto projects. At this stage, customers, who are essentially the initial general crypto investors, usually invest in various projects with high risk-reward ratios through micro-investment strategies.
For instance, if crypto user N plans to invest $2,000, they would distribute this budget across 10 projects with $200 units each, with the mindset that among these 10 projects, probably 7 or 8 would fail, but the revenue from the successful 2-3 projects would return the initial capital along with profit. In this model, the general investor usually has less sensitivity compared to the private investor, because they have already decided to buy the token and have prepared the desired amount. The responsibility of this group is to manage how much to allocate to which project among the various projects.
Regarding the Nicolo project, having an MVP of AI robot in the project makes the investment much more attractive and secure for the general crypto investors.

Furthermore, these general investors also manage portfolios for funds or other individuals. The structure of these portfolios is almost always such that at least 5 to 10 percent of the capital is invested in high-risk, high-reward projects like ICOs, from independent teams. And Nicolo, by virtue of having an MVP and being on-trend, is certainly among the selected products for capital distribution in these portfolios.

5: Settlement with Private Investor
At this stage, the principal amount + profit from the pre-sale is settled with the private investor who was the financier of the project's advertising costs (as per the partnership table).
It is worth mentioning that the return of investment and profit for the investor at this stage is independent of the success of the main Nicolo project. Nicolo is a state-of-the-art project, meaning it is at the highest level of programming development, encompassing many challenges and complexities. Each step of the growth process requires time, dynamism, and creativity in code and algorithm writing. While this feature is attractive, it can also be daunting, but the technical team and the general investors of the Nicolo token bear the pressure of this part of the project.
The private investor plays the role of financing the advertising budget, who will receive their secure and cash share at the end of IMO, independent of the success or failure of the main project plan.

6: Execution of the Main Project
The final project of Nicolo is to build a DLMT or Decentralized (SOTA) Machine Learning Transformer.
In brief, Nicolo aims to allow AI programmers to work on the development and improvement of artificial intelligence in a decentralized manner without being dependent on any specific company, and in return, earn revenue from the amount users pay for charging and using AI robots.

## Financial Table

The Nicolo platform requires $50,000 for marketing, which it will receive from a private investor.
After receiving the capital, the Nicolo team will spend this budget on advertising and community building for 75 days (2 and a half months).
In the next phase, the public sale of tokens begins, and this process will continue for about 75 to 90 days.
Immediately after the end of the IMO, the investor will receive his profit as follows.

The first $50,000 of the profit from the token sale directly belongs to the investor, and after that, 25% of the profit up to a ceiling of 1 million dollars belongs to the investor.
For example, if Nicolo tokens reach public sale for an amount of 2 million dollars (which, given the current market trend, is an average expected figure), 50% of this amount will be deposited to the buyers as a marketing reward.
From the remaining 1 million dollars, initially, $45,000 will belong to the investor. Then, from the remaining $955,000, 25% equivalent to $238,750 will belong to the investor, which in total will amount to $283,750 belonging to the investor.
